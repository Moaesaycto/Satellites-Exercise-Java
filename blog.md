Task 2 – Getting ready to attempt a mountain of a task by first tackling the whole idea of simulating the positions and file transfer mechanics (or at least the structure of how it will work in the future).

Working with the In Range function, and really putting my COMP2521 knowledge to the test to identify which devices are in range with each other, including through second order contact with relay satellites.

The final part of the current version of my assignment. All works except for when the satellites go out of range, where they simply pause the upload until they are in range again. I tried, but ulimtately couldn't fix it.
